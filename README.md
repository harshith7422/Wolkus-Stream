# Movie Library App

Welcome to the Movie Library App! This application allows users to manage and view their favorite movies in public and private lists.

## Features

- **Movie Library:** View a collection of movies.
- **Favorites:** Add movies to public or private favorites lists.
- **Authentication:** Sign up and sign in to manage your movie lists.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Movie Library App, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB (for backend data storage)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-library-app.git
   cd movie-library-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

1. **Backend Configuration:**

   - Make sure MongoDB is installed and running on your local machine or a remote server.
   - Update the MongoDB connection string in `server/index.js` if necessary.

2. **Frontend Configuration:**

   - Update API endpoints in `src/api/api.js` if your backend server runs on a different URL or port.

### Running the Application

1. **Start the backend server:**

   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

   This command starts the backend server using Node.js and Express.

2. **Start the frontend development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This command starts the React development server. The app will automatically open in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
